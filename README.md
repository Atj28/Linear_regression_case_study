# Project Name
> Bike Rental Demand Prediction
This project aims to predict the demand for bike rentals based on various factors such as weather conditions, seasonal trends, and user statistics. It utilizes a linear regression model to analyze the impact of different features on bike rental counts.

## General Information
Project Background: With the increasing popularity of bike-sharing programs, accurately predicting demand can optimize bike distribution and enhance user satisfaction. This project leverages data to inform decision-making processes for bike rental services.

Business Problem: The challenge faced by bike rental companies is the imbalance between bike availability and user demand. Mismanagement can lead to lost revenue and dissatisfied customers. The goal is to create a model that can forecast daily bike rentals accurately.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project is day.csv, which contains various features such as date, season, year, month, weather conditions, and user statistics (casual and registered users). The target variable for the model is cnt, which represents the total count of bike rentals.

## Conclusions
- The analysis revealed that certain weather conditions negatively impact bike rentals, with heavy rain and mist leading to decreased demand.
- Seasonal trends play a significant role, with spring and summer months showing higher rental counts compared to fall and winter.
- The number of casual users is a strong predictor of overall bike rentals, indicating that casual users are more sensitive to weather conditions than registered users.
- The model's R-squared value of 0.570 suggests that approximately 57% of the variability in bike rental counts can be explained by the selected features, indicating a reasonable fit.
